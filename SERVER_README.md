# PixivUtil2 - Server Mode

Server Mode (`server-repo/main`) is a divergent branch which modifies and optimizes PixivUtil2 towards more stability-oriented, server capabilities, including:
- transactional downloads of artworks and artwork metadata
- downloading of all artworks in ZIP format
- guarantees of unique artwork and artist path
- automatic skipping of AI downloads without making AJAX calls
